# Railway-Objects-Detection-by-Using-Improved-YOLO-Algorithm

The efficient and accurate detection of foreign objects on railway tracks is critical to ensuring the safety and smooth operation of train systems. This work addresses the limitations of existing foreign object detection methods, including low efficiency and suboptimal accuracy, by proposing an enhanced railway foreign object intrusion detection framework leveraging YOLOv8 and Overhaul Knowledge Distillation. The proposed method consists of a two-stage architecture. In the first stage, a lightweight image classification network quickly determines whether a railway image contains foreign objects. This stage minimizes reliance on computationally intensive object detection models, thereby enhancing detection speed. In the second stage, YOLOv8 is employed to precisely detect and localize foreign objects in images flagged by the classification network. The choice of YOLOv8 provides notable improvements in accuracy and inference speed over previous versions such as YOLOv3. Additionally, the Overhaul Knowledge Distillation algorithm is applied to train the lightweight classification network under the supervision of a larger, more robust network, ensuring competitive classification performance while maintaining efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both detection accuracy and speed, with significant improvements in FPS and detection robustness compared to earlier approaches.
